### 🔥 PEPTIDE-SPECIFIC SERVICES — KEY FINDING
3PLGuys has a **dedicated Peptide Fulfillment division** — this is huge for our use case.
- **URL:** https://3plguys.com/peptides
- **Peptide Form:** https://3plguys.com (peptides form)
- Temperature-controlled storage for peptide integrity
- Contamination prevention protocols
- Batch & lot tracking (critical for peptides)

### Industries Served

### Integrations
- **Shopify** ✅
- **WooCommerce** ✅
- **Amazon SP-API** ✅
- Custom WMS with real-time dashboards
- API connections available

### Pricing
- **NOT publicly listed** — must request a quote
- From Trustpilot review, older pricing references:
  - "No Inspection" box forwarding: $4/box (1-50), $3/box (51+)
  - Standard inspection + labeling: per-unit pricing (quote-based)
  - Credit card processing fee applied
- Industry standard for 3PL: fulfillment fees typically 25-35% of order value

### Onboarding
- Fill out the relevant form on their site (FBA, DTC, B2B, or **Peptides** form)
- Request a demo
- Timeline: Not specified, but they emphasize fast turnaround

### Reviews — MIXED
- **Trustpilot:** 2.7/5 — "Poor" rating
  - Negative: Lost products worth tens of thousands; hidden fees; billing disputes
  - One detailed complaint about being charged "Box Forwarding" (no-inspection fee) despite inspection being performed
- **Google Reviews:** Positive quotes on their site — "world class, fast turnaround, fair prices, good communication"
- **Reddit (r/FulfillmentByAmazon):** Mixed — some users happy, others cautious
- **ProvenExpert:** Profile exists but limited data

### Pros
- ✅ Dedicated peptide fulfillment division (rare!)
- ✅ FDA-registered, temperature-controlled warehouse
- ✅ Near LA/Long Beach ports (great for imports)
- ✅ Shopify + WooCommerce integration
- ✅ Batch/lot tracking
- ✅ 100,000+ sq ft facility
- ✅ China inspection services (for sourcing QC)

### Cons
- ⚠️ Trustpilot 2.7/5 — serious complaints about lost inventory and billing
- ⚠️ No public pricing — have to request quote
- ⚠️ Primarily known for Amazon FBA (peptides division is newer)
- ⚠️ No mention of MOQ or minimum monthly orders publicly

### Recommendation
**Worth contacting for a quote.** The dedicated peptide division is a strong differentiator — most 3PLs won't touch peptides. The poor Trustpilot reviews are a concern, but those seem to be from Amazon FBA sellers (different workflow). Request references specifically from peptide clients.

### TIER 4: Other Mentions (Not Primary Fit)

| Supplier | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **Biosynth** (biosynth.com) | Custom peptide manufacturer, GMP facility in MA + Netherlands. More pharma/clinical-grade. Likely very expensive, long lead times. Not a good fit for research peptide resale. |
| **Phoenix Pharmaceuticals** (phoenixpeptide.com) | B2B peptide wholesaler, USA manufacturer. More focused on research antibodies/assay kits. Worth contacting but different market segment. |
| **Core Peptides** (corepeptides.com) | USA-made peptides and blends. No visible wholesale program. Retail-focused. |
| **US Peptides** | Couldn't find a clear standalone site. May be defunct or rebranded. |
| **PeptidesForSale** | Couldn't find a standalone site. Likely a generic search term. |
| **Limitless Life Nootropics** | Primarily nootropics brand. May carry some peptides. Not a bulk supplier. |
| **GenX Peptides** | Limited web presence. Couldn't verify. |
| **Peptide Pros** (peptidepros.net) | USA only, wholesale peptides advertised, 4,200+ 5-star reviews. Worth checking. |
| **Verified Peptides** (verifiedpeptides.com) | Tiered pricing 5-25% off for wholesale. Could be worth exploring. |
