## Top 3 Recommendation

### 🥇 #1: CaliberPeptides (caliberpeptides.com)

**The pick.**

- **"Caliber"** implies precision, quality, and high standards — exactly what research peptide buyers want
- Contains **"peptides"** for strong SEO targeting on research peptide keywords
- Short enough to be memorable, professional enough to feel established
- **Pairs beautifully with VitaRevive**: VitaRevive (wellness/vitality) + CaliberPeptides (precision/science) — complementary tones without overlap
- Easy to say, spell, and remember. No ambiguity.
- Both .com and .co available — lock them down

### 🥈 #2: SovereignPeptides (sovereignpeptides.com)

- **"Sovereign"** conveys independence, authority, and premium quality
- Strong peptide SEO keyword inclusion
- Slightly longer to type/spell, which is the main drawback
- Pairs well with VitaRevive — both names feel premium and intentional
- Risk: "sovereign" has some political/ideological connotations in certain communities that could be polarizing

### 🥉 #3: FortisLabs (fortislabs.com)

- **"Fortis"** (Latin for strong) sounds scientific and established
- **"Labs"** reinforces the research/science angle
- Most brandable and shortest name — great for logos, merch, social handles
- Excellent VitaRevive pairing: both feel like premium DTC brands in the same portfolio
- **Downside**: No "peptide" keyword = weaker organic SEO for peptide-specific searches. Would need to compensate with content strategy.

## Final Recommendation

**Go with CaliberPeptides.**

It hits every criterion: full domain availability, contains the SEO keyword, sounds authoritative and trustworthy, pairs naturally with VitaRevive as a sister brand, and is easy to remember and spell. Register `caliberpeptides.com` and `caliberpeptides.co` immediately.

If CaliberPeptides doesn't resonate personally, FortisLabs is the strong alternative — it's the most brandable name on the list and would make an excellent premium research brand, with slightly more content marketing needed to compensate for the missing keyword.
