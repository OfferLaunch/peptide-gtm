---

| Person | Role | Primary Responsibilities |
|--------|------|------------------------|
| **Dawson** | Founder/CEO | Final decisions, payment processing, legal, strategy |

| **Jake Arnold** | Marketing/Funnels | Website builds, landing pages, checkout flow, email funnels |

## Product & Pricing Matrix

### Research Brand Pricing (Target: 70%+ margin pre-ad)

| Product | Size | COGS (Novara) | Competitor Price | Our Price | Margin |
|---------|------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| Semaglutide | 5mg | ~$35 | $239-339 | $199 | 82% |
| Tirzepatide | 10mg | ~$40 | $169-199 | $179 | 78% |
| Retatrutide | 5mg | ~$45 | $199-279 | $219 | 79% |
| BPC-157 | 5mg | ~$29 | $45-60 | $49 | 41%* |
| NAD+ | 500mg | ~$35 | $75-89 | $79 | 56% |
| Sermorelin | 5mg | ~$32 | $59-89 | $69 | 54% |
| GHK-Cu | 50mg | ~$30 | $55-75 | $59 | 49% |
| CJC-1295/Ipamorelin | Blend | ~$38 | $79-119 | $89 | 57% |

*BPC-157 is a traffic driver, not a margin play. Bundle it.*

**Custom branding surcharge (Novara):** +40% COGS + $15/label. Factor into pricing.

### VitaRevive Pricing (Premium positioning, 75%+ margin target)

| Product | Peptide | Price | COGS (branded) | Margin |
|---------|---------|-------|----------------|--------|
| VitaRevive Sculpt | Semaglutide 5mg | $279 | ~$64 | 77% |
| VitaRevive Sculpt Pro | Tirzepatide 10mg | $249 | ~$71 | 72% |
| VitaRevive Restore | BPC-157 5mg | $69 | ~$56 | 19%** |
| VitaRevive Thrive | CJC/Ipa Blend | $119 | ~$68 | 43% |
| VitaRevive Glow | GHK-Cu 50mg | $89 | ~$57 | 36% |

**With Novara custom branding, lower-ticket items have compressed margins. Mitigation: negotiate volume pricing OR use YourPeptideBrand for VitaRevive-branded items where Novara margins are thin.

### Bundle Strategy (Margin Maximizer)
- **Research Brand "Stack Packs":** BPC + GHK-Cu ($99, saves $9) — blended margin improves
- **VitaRevive "Ritual Kits":** Sculpt + Restore ($329, saves $19) — anchors high AOV
- **Subscription:** 10% discount, auto-ship every 4 weeks — reduces CAC, locks LTV

- Logo and domain don't block Shopify setup (use placeholder).

### Zelle Payment Risk Mitigation (Novara)
1. Get itemized invoice via email before every payment
2. Start with small test order ($500-1K) to verify fulfillment
3. Document everything — screenshots of Zelle confirmations
4. Negotiate partial payment terms (50% up front, 50% on ship)
5. Have YourPeptideBrand ready as instant backup
6. Long-term: push for ACH/wire capability

## PAID ADVERTISING STRATEGY

### Meta (Facebook + Instagram) — Primary Channel

**Research Brand:**
- **Audiences:** Bodybuilding interest, biohacking, peptide research, supplement buyers, competitor brand followers
- **Creative style:** Direct response. Bold claims (compliant). Price comparisons. "Lab-tested, shipped fast." Dark backgrounds, clean product shots.
- **Funnel:** Cold → product page → purchase. Short funnel, these buyers know what they want.
- **Ad types:** Static image (product + price), carousel (product lineup), video (60s educational)

**VitaRevive:**
- **Audiences:** Women 30-60, wellness interest, weight loss journey, menopause, Goop/Well+Good readers, Noom/WW past users
- **Creative style:** UGC testimonial-style, warm lifestyle imagery, educational hooks. "I didn't think peptides were for me until..."
- **Funnel:** Cold → quiz/lead magnet → email nurture → purchase. Longer consideration cycle.
- **Ad types:** UGC video (60-90s), carousel (education), story ads (quiz CTA)

### Budget Ramp

| Week | Daily Spend | Monthly Run Rate | Focus |
|------|------------|-----------------|-------|
| Week 5-6 (Soft Launch) | $35/day | $1,050/mo | Testing only. Meta. |
| Week 7-8 (Full Launch) | $200/day | $6,000/mo | Meta + TikTok. Scale winners. |
| Month 3 | $500/day | $15,000/mo | Add Google. Full funnel. |
| Month 4 | $750/day | $22,500/mo | Scale what works. Kill what doesn't. |
| Month 5-6 | $1,000/day | $30,000/mo | Aggressive scale if ROAS holds. |

### TikTok Strategy
- UGC-first. "Day 1 vs Day 30" format. "Things I wish I knew about peptides."
- Spark Ads (boost organic-looking content)
- VitaRevive-heavy — TikTok skews female and wellness-curious
- Budget: 25% of total ad spend

### Google Strategy
- **Shopping:** Product feeds for both brands. High-intent, high-conversion.
- **Search:** Branded terms, competitor terms ("buy semaglutide online," "tirzepatide research"), educational queries
- **Display/YouTube:** Retargeting only (not prospecting)
- Budget: 20% of total ad spend

## COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

### FDA Compliance
- [ ] All products labeled "For research use only — not for human consumption" (Research Brand)
- [ ] VitaRevive: Determine regulatory pathway (research chemicals vs. telehealth/Rx model)
- [ ] No disease claims on any marketing material
- [ ] FDA disclaimer on all product pages and marketing
- [ ] No "FDA approved" language (even for semaglutide — YOUR product isn't FDA approved)

### FTC Compliance
- [ ] All influencer partnerships include proper disclosure (#ad, #sponsored)
- [ ] Testimonials include "individual results may vary" disclaimer
- [ ] No income claims for affiliate program
- [ ] No fake reviews or manufactured social proof
- [ ] Substantiation file for any benefit claims (link to published research)

### Payment Processor Compliance
- [ ] Accurate MCC code on merchant application (don't misrepresent product type)
- [ ] Terms of Service clearly state products are for research only
- [ ] Refund policy clearly stated (30-day, no-hassle recommended)
- [ ] No chargebacks above 1% threshold (respond to all disputes within 24h)
- [ ] PCI compliance via Shopify (handled by platform)

### Website Compliance
- [ ] Terms of Service
- [ ] Privacy Policy (CCPA + GDPR compliant)
- [ ] Cookie consent banner
- [ ] Age verification (18+ checkbox at checkout)
- [ ] Shipping restrictions clearly stated (US only to start)
- [ ] Disclaimers on every product page
- [ ] "Consult your healthcare provider" language throughout

### ⚠️ VitaRevive Compliance Risk
VitaRevive's warm, wellness-forward branding is CLOSE to implying human consumption. Mitigation options:
1. **Option A:** Keep "research use only" but make the brand experience premium (current plan)
2. **Option B:** Partner with telehealth provider (Jase Medical model) — products become Rx, higher legitimacy, higher compliance burden
3. **Option C:** Sell through compounding pharmacy partnership — most compliant, most complex

**Recommendation:** Launch with Option A, explore Option B by Month 3. Legal counsel required.

## TECH STACK

### E-Commerce Platform: Shopify (Basic → Plus)
- **Why Shopify:** Fast to launch, app ecosystem, handles PCI, scales well
- **Why not custom/GitHub Pages:** No checkout, no inventory management, no payment processing
- **Migration path:** Shopify Basic ($39/mo) → Shopify ($105/mo) at $10K/mo → Shopify Plus ($2,300/mo) at $50K+/mo

### Payment Processors (Peptide-Friendly)
Apply to ALL THREE simultaneously — peptide merchants get denied frequently:

1. **Durango Merchant Services** — specializes in high-risk/nutraceutical. Higher fees (3.5-4.5%) but peptide-friendly. APPLY FIRST.
2. **PayKickstart / NMI** — alternative high-risk processor. Good Shopify integration.
3. **Bankcard International Group (BIG)** — another high-risk option.
4. **Crypto payments (BitPay/Coinbase Commerce)** — add as alternative. Some peptide buyers prefer crypto.
5. **Backup: Square/Stripe** — apply but expect denial for peptides. Worth trying.

**Expected processing fees:** 3.5-5% + $0.30/transaction (high-risk markup)

## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

### Research Brand Positioning

**Tagline candidates:** "Research Grade. Fair Price." / "No Markup. No BS." / "Pure Peptides. Period."

**Positioning:** Mid-price leader. Not the cheapest (that's sketchy), not the most expensive (that's markup). Third-party tested, fast shipping, straightforward.

**Key differentiators vs. competitors:**
1. **Price:** 10-20% below premium brands (Peptide Sciences, Paradigm Peptides) while maintaining quality
2. **Speed:** Same-day or next-day shipping on in-stock items
3. **Transparency:** COAs (Certificates of Analysis) on every product page
4. **No minimum order** — competitors sometimes have $100+ minimums
5. **Bundle deals** that actually save money

### VitaRevive Positioning

**Tagline:** "Feel like you again."

**Positioning:** The ONLY peptide brand built for women. Not repurposed bodybuilder products with pink labels. Purpose-built brand, voice, product naming, and experience for women 30-60.

**Key differentiators:**
1. **Only brand speaking directly to women** in a market full of bro-science
2. **Warm, premium brand experience** — from unboxing to ongoing support
3. **Educational-first approach** — quiz, content, community before hard sell
4. **Product names that make sense** — "Sculpt," "Restore," "Glow" vs. clinical peptide names
5. **Community** — private group, shared journeys, not transactional
