# Peptide E-Commerce Go-To-Market Strategy
## Two-Brand Launch: [Research Brand] + VitaRevive

**Version:** 2.0 | **Updated:** February 13, 2026 | **Owner:** Dawson (Founder)

---

## Executive Summary

We are launching two peptide e-commerce brands simultaneously to capture both ends of the market:

- **Brand 1 (Research Brand — name TBD):** Bodybuilders, biohackers, researchers. Direct, no-BS positioning. "For research use only." Domain candidates: CorePeptides.co, CaliberPeptides.co, SovereignPeptides.co.
- **Brand 2 (VitaRevive — vitarevive.co):** Women 30-60, moms, weight loss seekers. Warm wellness positioning. Full brand bible complete.

**Timeline:** 8-week launch → scale through Month 6
**Revenue Target:** $50K/mo by Month 3, $150K/mo by Month 6

### Fulfillment Model: 3PL via 3PLGuys.com
- Bulk inventory ordered from supplier → shipped to 3PLGuys FDA-registered, temperature-controlled warehouse (near LA ports)
- 3PLGuys handles pick/pack/ship to customers via their dedicated **Peptide Fulfillment** division
- Shopify integration, batch/lot tracking, compliance documentation
- Higher upfront inventory investment, but better shipping speed, QC, and multi-supplier flexibility

### Suppliers (Top Picks — Quotes Pending)
| Supplier | Strength | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Licensed Peptides Wholesale** | GMP-certified CA lab, white label, tiered pricing | 🔴 Contact for quote |
| **Evolve Peptides** | 50+ peptides, broadest catalog, bulk wholesale | 🔴 Contact for quote |
| **Peprion** | Best GLP-1 pricing ($0.21-0.77/mg) | 🔴 Contact for quote |
| Novara Peptides | Backup — Zelle-only payment, drop-ship model | Backup |
| YourPeptideBrand | Backup — turnkey white-label, drop-ship focused | Backup |

### Dual-Brand Model: Same Catalog, Different Branding
Both brands sell the **same product catalog** (unified SKUs, same vials from same supplier). The difference is labels and pricing:
- **Research Brand:** Competitive pricing, clinical peptide names (Semaglutide, BPC-157, etc.)
- **VitaRevive:** Premium pricing, consumer-friendly names (Sculpt, Restore, Glow, etc.)

## Product & Pricing Matrix

### Unified SKU Catalog

Both brands sell the same 8 core peptides. COGS estimates below are **pre-quote** — actual pricing depends on which supplier wins.

**COGS Estimates (Wholesale/Bulk — No Branding Surcharge)**

| Product | Size | Est. COGS Range | Notes |
|---------|------|-----------------|-------|
| Semaglutide | 5mg | $5-25 | Peprion could be lowest; Licensed Peptides mid-range |
| Tirzepatide | 10mg | $5-25 | Peprion excels here |
| Retatrutide | 5mg | $10-30 | Fewer suppliers, may be higher |
| BPC-157 | 5mg | $15-30 | Widely available |
| NAD+ | 500mg | $15-30 | Check Evolve catalog |
| Sermorelin | 5mg | $15-25 | Widely available |
| GHK-Cu | 50mg | $15-25 | Widely available |
| CJC-1295/Ipamorelin | Blend | $15-30 | Check availability as pre-blended |

*Note: Peprion quotes $0.21-0.77/mg on GLP-1s — if accurate, Semaglutide 5mg could be as low as ~$1-4/vial at scale. Verify with actual quote.*

### Research Brand Pricing (Target: 75%+ margin pre-ad)

| Product | Our Price | Est. COGS | Est. Margin |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Semaglutide 5mg | $199 | ~$15 | 92% |
| Tirzepatide 10mg | $179 | ~$15 | 92% |
| Retatrutide 5mg | $219 | ~$20 | 91% |
| BPC-157 5mg | $49 | ~$20 | 59% |
| NAD+ 500mg | $79 | ~$20 | 75% |
| Sermorelin 5mg | $69 | ~$18 | 74% |
| GHK-Cu 50mg | $59 | ~$18 | 69% |
| CJC-1295/Ipamorelin Blend | $89 | ~$20 | 78% |

*BPC-157 is a traffic driver, not a margin play. Bundle it.*

### VitaRevive Pricing (Premium positioning, 80%+ margin target on GLP-1s)

| VitaRevive Name | Peptide | Price | Est. COGS | Est. Margin |
|-----------------|---------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| VitaRevive Sculpt | Semaglutide 5mg | $279 | ~$15 | 95% |
| VitaRevive Sculpt Pro | Tirzepatide 10mg | $249 | ~$15 | 94% |
| VitaRevive Restore | BPC-157 5mg | $69 | ~$20 | 71% |
| VitaRevive Thrive | CJC/Ipa Blend | $119 | ~$20 | 83% |
| VitaRevive Glow | GHK-Cu 50mg | $89 | ~$18 | 80% |

*Without Novara's 40% markup + $15/label surcharge, VitaRevive margins are dramatically better. Custom labels printed separately and applied at 3PL.*

### Bundle Strategy (Margin Maximizer)
- **Research Brand "Stack Packs":** BPC + GHK-Cu ($99, saves $9) — blended margin improves
- **VitaRevive "Ritual Kits":** Sculpt + Restore ($329, saves $19) — anchors high AOV
- **Subscription:** 10% discount, auto-ship every 4 weeks — reduces CAC, locks LTV

### Dependencies & Blockers
- ❗ **Payment processor is the #1 blocker.** Apply Day 1. Approval can take 5-14 days for peptide merchants.
- ❗ **Supplier quotes needed before inventory commitment.** Compare Licensed Peptides, Evolve, and Peprion before ordering.
- ❗ **3PLGuys quote needed to finalize unit economics.** Fulfillment cost per order affects margin calculations.
- ❗ **Brand name must be finalized before design work begins** on Research Brand.
- Logo and domain don't block Shopify setup (use placeholder).

### KPIs for Phase 0
- [ ] Both brand names + domains secured
- [ ] Supplier quotes received (at least 2 of 3 new suppliers)
- [ ] 3PLGuys quote received and onboarding started
- [ ] Payment processor application submitted (approval pending OK)
- [ ] LLC formed, EIN received
- [ ] Both Shopify stores initialized
- [ ] All social handles secured

### Budget: Phase 0
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Domains (2x .co) | $60 |
| LLC formation (Wyoming) | $150 |
| Shopify (2 stores, Basic plan) | $79/mo x2 = $158/mo |
| Softriver (logo work) | TBD (existing contract) |
| **Total Phase 0** | **~$500-1,000** |

*Note: No test inventory in Phase 0 — bulk order happens in Phase 1 after supplier selection and 3PL onboarding.*

## PHASE 1: BUILD (Week 3-4)

- ❗ Supplier order + shipping to 3PLGuys has lead time (estimate 1-2 weeks)
- ❗ 3PLGuys Shopify integration must be live before launch
- ❗ Product photos block site launch (use placeholder/mockup if needed)

### KPIs for Phase 1
- [ ] Both sites live (even if in password-protected mode)
- [ ] Checkout flow tested end-to-end with real payment
- [ ] Email flows built and tested (minimum: welcome + abandoned cart)
- [ ] 10+ blog posts written and staged
- [ ] Ad creative library: 20+ static, 10+ video concepts
- [ ] Bulk inventory ordered and en route to 3PLGuys
- [ ] 3PLGuys Shopify integration confirmed working

### Budget: Phase 1
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Shopify apps (Klaviyo, quiz, reviews) | ~$100/mo |
| Shopify themes (premium x2) | $350 x2 = $700 |
| **Bulk inventory order (8 SKUs, 25-50 units each)** | ~$3,000-8,000* |
| Custom label printing (2 brands x 8 SKUs) | ~$500-1,000 |
| AI product photography / mockups | $200-500 |
| Legal review | $500-1,500 |
| Softriver (packaging design) | TBD |
| **Total Phase 1** | **~$5,000-12,000** |

*Inventory cost depends heavily on supplier quotes. Peprion GLP-1 pricing could make this much lower. Without Novara's 40% + $15/label surcharge, COGS drops significantly.*

*Significant margin improvement vs. old Novara model (was ~38% net). Bulk wholesale pricing + no custom branding surcharge = ~$20-30 lower COGS per unit.*

---

## PAID ADVERTISING STRATEGY

### Meta (Facebook + Instagram) — Primary Channel

**Research Brand:**
- **Audiences:** Bodybuilding interest, biohacking, peptide research, supplement buyers, competitor brand followers
- **Creative style:** Direct response. Bold claims (compliant). Price comparisons. "Lab-tested, shipped fast." Dark backgrounds, clean product shots.
- **Funnel:** Cold → product page → purchase. Short funnel, these buyers know what they want.
- **Ad types:** Static image (product + price), carousel (product lineup), video (60s educational)

**VitaRevive:**
- **Audiences:** Women 30-60, wellness interest, weight loss journey, menopause, Goop/Well+Good readers, Noom/WW past users
- **Creative style:** UGC testimonial-style, warm lifestyle imagery, educational hooks. "I didn't think peptides were for me until..."
- **Funnel:** Cold → quiz/lead magnet → email nurture → purchase. Longer consideration cycle.
- **Ad types:** UGC video (60-90s), carousel (education), story ads (quiz CTA)

### Budget Ramp

| Week | Daily Spend | Monthly Run Rate | Focus |
|------|------------|-----------------|-------|
| Week 5-6 (Soft Launch) | $35/day | $1,050/mo | Testing only. Meta. |
| Week 7-8 (Full Launch) | $200/day | $6,000/mo | Meta + TikTok. Scale winners. |
| Month 3 | $500/day | $15,000/mo | Add Google. Full funnel. |
| Month 4 | $750/day | $22,500/mo | Scale what works. Kill what doesn't. |
| Month 5-6 | $1,000/day | $30,000/mo | Aggressive scale if ROAS holds. |

### TikTok Strategy
- UGC-first. "Day 1 vs Day 30" format. "Things I wish I knew about peptides."
- Spark Ads (boost organic-looking content)
- VitaRevive-heavy — TikTok skews female and wellness-curious
- Budget: 25% of total ad spend

### Google Strategy
- **Shopping:** Product feeds for both brands. High-intent, high-conversion.
- **Search:** Branded terms, competitor terms ("buy semaglutide online," "tirzepatide research"), educational queries
- **Display/YouTube:** Retargeting only (not prospecting)
- Budget: 20% of total ad spend

## EMAIL MARKETING FUNNEL

### Platform: Klaviyo (both brands, separate accounts)

### Automated Flows

**1. Welcome Series (triggers on email signup)**
- Email 1 (immediate): Welcome + brand story + 15% first order code
- Email 2 (Day 2): "What are peptides?" educational
- Email 3 (Day 4): Social proof — reviews, testimonials
- Email 4 (Day 6): Product recommendation based on quiz/interest
- Email 5 (Day 8): Urgency — "Your 15% code expires tomorrow"

## COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

### FDA Compliance
- [ ] All products labeled "For research use only — not for human consumption" (Research Brand)
- [ ] VitaRevive: Determine regulatory pathway (research chemicals vs. telehealth/Rx model)
- [ ] No disease claims on any marketing material
- [ ] FDA disclaimer on all product pages and marketing
- [ ] No "FDA approved" language (even for semaglutide — YOUR product isn't FDA approved)
- [ ] 3PLGuys FDA-registered facility maintains compliance documentation

### FTC Compliance
- [ ] All influencer partnerships include proper disclosure (#ad, #sponsored)
- [ ] Testimonials include "individual results may vary" disclaimer
- [ ] No income claims for affiliate program
- [ ] No fake reviews or manufactured social proof
- [ ] Substantiation file for any benefit claims (link to published research)

### Payment Processor Compliance
- [ ] Accurate MCC code on merchant application (don't misrepresent product type)
- [ ] Terms of Service clearly state products are for research only
- [ ] Refund policy clearly stated (30-day, no-hassle recommended)
- [ ] No chargebacks above 1% threshold (respond to all disputes within 24h)
- [ ] PCI compliance via Shopify (handled by platform)

### Website Compliance
- [ ] Terms of Service

- [ ] Cookie consent banner
- [ ] Age verification (18+ checkbox at checkout)
- [ ] Shipping restrictions clearly stated (US only to start)
- [ ] Disclaimers on every product page
- [ ] "Consult your healthcare provider" language throughout

### ⚠️ VitaRevive Compliance Risk
VitaRevive's warm, wellness-forward branding is CLOSE to implying human consumption. Mitigation options:
1. **Option A:** Keep "research use only" but make the brand experience premium (current plan)
2. **Option B:** Partner with telehealth provider (Jase Medical model) — products become Rx, higher legitimacy, higher compliance burden
3. **Option C:** Sell through compounding pharmacy partnership — most compliant, most complex

**Recommendation:** Launch with Option A, explore Option B by Month 3. Legal counsel required.

## TECH STACK

### E-Commerce Platform: Shopify (Basic → Plus)
- **Why Shopify:** Fast to launch, app ecosystem, handles PCI, scales well, 3PLGuys has native integration
- **Migration path:** Shopify Basic ($39/mo) → Shopify ($105/mo) at $10K/mo → Shopify Plus ($2,300/mo) at $50K+/mo

### 3PL: 3PLGuys (Peptide Fulfillment Division)
- FDA-registered, temperature-controlled warehouse
- 100,000+ sq ft facility, 13 miles from LA/Long Beach ports
- Shopify + WooCommerce integration
- Batch/lot tracking, compliance documentation
- **Status:** Quote pending — fill out peptide form at 3plguys.com/peptides

### Payment Processors (Peptide-Friendly)
Apply to ALL THREE simultaneously — peptide merchants get denied frequently:

1. **Durango Merchant Services** — specializes in high-risk/nutraceutical. Higher fees (3.5-4.5%) but peptide-friendly. APPLY FIRST.
2. **PayKickstart / NMI** — alternative high-risk processor. Good Shopify integration.
3. **Bankcard International Group (BIG)** — another high-risk option.
4. **Crypto payments (BitPay/Coinbase Commerce)** — add as alternative. Some peptide buyers prefer crypto.
5. **Backup: Square/Stripe** — apply but expect denial for peptides. Worth trying.

**Expected processing fees:** 3.5-5% + $0.30/transaction (high-risk markup)

## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

### Research Brand Positioning

**Tagline candidates:** "Research Grade. Fair Price." / "No Markup. No BS." / "Pure Peptides. Period."

**Positioning:** Mid-price leader. Not the cheapest (that's sketchy), not the most expensive (that's markup). Third-party tested, fast shipping, straightforward.

**Key differentiators vs. competitors:**
1. **Price:** 10-20% below premium brands (Peptide Sciences, Paradigm Peptides) while maintaining quality
2. **Speed:** Fast shipping via 3PLGuys (LA-based, near ports)
3. **Transparency:** COAs (Certificates of Analysis) on every product page
4. **No minimum order** — competitors sometimes have $100+ minimums
5. **Bundle deals** that actually save money

### VitaRevive Positioning

**Tagline:** "Feel like you again."

**Positioning:** The ONLY peptide brand built for women. Not repurposed bodybuilder products with pink labels. Purpose-built brand, voice, product naming, and experience for women 30-60.

**Key differentiators:**
1. **Only brand speaking directly to women** in a market full of bro-science
2. **Warm, premium brand experience** — from unboxing to ongoing support
3. **Educational-first approach** — quiz, content, community before hard sell
4. **Product names that make sense** — "Sculpt," "Restore," "Glow" vs. clinical peptide names
5. **Community** — private group, shared journeys, not transactional
