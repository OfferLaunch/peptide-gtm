## Summary & Recommendations

### Best Availability (Brand 1 — Research Brand)

| Rank | Name | Available Handles | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🥇 | **CaliberPeptides** | 4/4 platforms likely available | Cleanest option — no conflicts found anywhere |
| 🥈 | **SovereignPeptides** | 4/4 platforms likely available | Also fully clean — strong premium positioning |

| 6th | **CorePeptides** | 2-3/4 | Instagram taken; existing business with same name |
| 7th | **SynthCore** | 1-2/4 | Music genre name; Instagram & Facebook conflicts |

### Brand 2 — VitaRevive
**VitaRevive** has significant conflicts — Instagram, Twitter/X, and Facebook are all taken by an existing wellness spa business (Vita Wellness Spa in Parkville, MD) that uses vitarevive.com. TikTok appears available. **Consider alternative handles** like @VitaReviveWellness, @VitaReviveHealth, or a different brand name entirely to avoid confusion.
